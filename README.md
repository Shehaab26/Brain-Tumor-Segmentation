# Data Analysis and Prediction with Python

> Data Science project based on a Kaggle notebook

This project is a complete data analysis and machine learning workflow designed to explore a dataset, clean and visualize it, and build a predictive model. It was developed based on the code from the Kaggle notebook: [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shehaabyasser/notebookfeadd03f6c/notebook), with improvements in code structure, documentation, and readability.

## 📌 Project Overview

The main steps included in this project are:
- **Loading the dataset** from a CSV file.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data distributions and relationships.
- **Data cleaning** (handling missing values, encoding, outlier detection, etc.).
- **Data visualization** using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- **Building a machine learning model** (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression).
- **Model evaluation** using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and other metrics.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` – for data manipulation
  - `numpy` – for numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` – for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` – for machine learning modeling
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
